When we got clobbered in 2016 I needed a break, so I became a contractor with a focus on cloud compute, systems programming and data systems. I shaped that work into a what I thought might be a startup, <a href=\"https://karrots.app\">Karrots</a>, but with two kids in college I needed to give everyone a couple years break from startup stress and grind.</p>\n<p>Eventually I want to return to robots and hardware, but because my life these days is mostly systems software at scale, I want to share some of the way that I have applied ZeroDiff to software over the years. The goal now is to run more formal experiments and write about them.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-01-02T12:08:17+00:00", "date_published": "2025-11-22T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}]}
