## A New Way to Design and Develop Products

### A Simple Philosophy

>If you maintain zero difference between prototype and production designs, you can release or mass produce any revision even when you iterate designs rapidly.

### Corollary

>Always manufacture prototype and production designs with the same process and tooling - **always**.

## Overview

### Philosophy

If you maintain zero difference between prototype and production, you can release any revision even when iterating rapidly.

### Impact

- For Software: your dev cluster *is* production. Every commit can go live.
- For Hardware: your enclosures and PCBs use production tooling. Every revision is manufacturing-ready.

### Result

Iterate with real users in days, not months. No "big bang" releases. Scale at any moment.
