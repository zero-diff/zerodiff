# About ZeroDiff

For years, this site focused on hardware—how to iterate PCBs and enclosures the way software teams iterate code. After work in both domains, I realize they solve similar problems in parallel, often unaware of each other's solutions.

After a long break, I've expanded this to cover both. The hardware guides are more developed because that's where I've spent more time. Software insights will build over time, informed by the same zerodiff principles.

Both industries can learn from each other, and I learn when I write about both.
